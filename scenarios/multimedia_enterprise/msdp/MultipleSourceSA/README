PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the behavior of MSDP enabled hosts when multicast sources and receivers lie
in different AS.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there are two MCBR sessions, with node 13, 14 being the multicast
sources and node 6 and 7 multicast receivers. Node 2 and 9 are MSDP enabled hosts 
with both acting as RP.
