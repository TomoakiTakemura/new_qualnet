To show the behavior of a host when its peer is configured as a default peer.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 1 being the multicast
source and node 12 multicast receiver. Node 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 13 are MSDP
enabled hosts with node 2, 4, 7, 9 and 13 acting as RP.

                                   RP
