PURPOSE:-
--------
To show the behavior of a host when it receives an SA message from a non-mesh
peer.



SCENARIO:-
---------
In this scenario, there is one MCBR session, with node 4 being the multicast
source and node 7 multicast receiver. Node 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are MSDP enabled 
hosts with node 6 acting as RP. A mesh-group is configured with members node 
1, 2, 3 and 6.
