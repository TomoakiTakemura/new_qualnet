Node 1 through 20 are in one Wireless Subnet forming the CCH
Node 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 ,10, 13, 14, 15, 16,17 and  20 are on other
Wireless Subnet forming SCH.

Both CCH and SCH are operating on separate channels.


Node 1 is sending CBR packet to 20
Node 3 is sending CBR packet to 9
Node 14 is sending CBR packet to 16
