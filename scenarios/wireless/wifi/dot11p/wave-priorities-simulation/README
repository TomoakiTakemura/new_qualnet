PURPOSE:-
--------
To test the application priority on different channels.

Node 1 to 10 are connected to two Wireless Subnet forming the CCH and SCH channels.

Both CCH and SCH are operating on separate channels.

Static routes are configured such that control channel interface communicates
between themselves only and service interface communicates with other
service channel interfaces.


Applications are configured so that higher priority packets are transmitted on CCH
and lower priority packets are transmitted on SCH.
