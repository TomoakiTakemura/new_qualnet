PURPOSE:-
--------
To test concurrent socket and DIS or HLA interfaces in same scenario.

SCENARIO:-
---------
  
This is the vrforces-CommDemo scenario but using GENERICMAC instead
of MAC-LINK-16. In this scenario, the M1A1 1 entity tells the UAV to 
turn on its sensors and look for the enemy. The UAV will move towards 
the enemy and will report their location. The two tanks will move to the 
enemy and attack them. Nodes 7 and 8 are mapped with socket interface and
following messages are sent between the mapped nodes.

	CreatePlatform message 
	UpdatePlatform message 
	CommEffectsRequest message (TCP/UDP)
	PrintSendMessage
	QuerySimulationState message 
	Read
	Write
	PauseSimulation message 
	StopSimulation

  
 TEST PROCIDURE:
 --------------
 1. Run "<QUALNET_HOME>/bin/mts-socket.exe CommsDemoWithSocketInterface.mtsfile".
 
 2. Run "<QULANET_HOME>/bin/qualnet CommsDemoWithSocketInterface-dis.config".
 
 3. Run VR Force Scenario in VR Force GUI.
 
 4. In this scenario, the M1A1 1 entity tells the UAV to turn on its sensors
    and look for the enemy. The UAV will move towards the enemy and will report
    their location. The two tanks will move to the enemy and attack them. 
    The scenario passes if the enemy is destroyed. All all the Socket Interface 
    messages will be successful which can be verified by reponse.log file.
